In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off.

The summary describes implementing multi-tenancy Phase 1 for UTAGE3.0, changing Tenant.id from `String @default(cuid())` to `Int @default(autoincrement())`.\n\n2. **Answering Pending Questions**: \n   - Confirmed errors in `usecase/quiz/index.ts` and `usecase/user/index.ts` were already fixed (tenantId changed from \"default-tenant\" to 1)\n   - Advised that `// TODO: Phase 2でFirebase Tenant IDから動的に取得する` comment should remain\n\n3. **TypeScript Type Errors Found**: Running `pnpm --filter backend typecheck` revealed 17 errors in repository files where `tenantId: string` needed to be `tenantId: number`. Files: user.ts, payment.ts, businesscard.ts, event.ts, pack.ts, quiz.ts in `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/`.\n\n4. **Fixed Repository Files**: Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in all 6 repository files (14 method parameters total).\n\n5. **TypeCheck Passed**: After fixes, `pnpm --filter backend typecheck` passed.\n\n6. **Tests Passed**: 52/52 tests passed. 5 test suites failed due to missing env vars (pre-existing issue).\n\n7. **PR Discussion**: User asked about branch name and commit message. Suggested `feat/tenant-id-autoincrement` and `feat: change Tenant.id from cuid to autoincrement integer`.\n\n8. **Go Backend Colleague Comments**: Discussion about CI migration workflow. Colleagues suggested:\n   - Seed in CI not needed (only first time)\n   - CI migration not needed (infrequent)\n   - CI seed creates DDL outside schema.sql (fragile)\n   - Manual migration with procedure docs instead\n\n9. **CI \"おしゃれ\" Comment**: User asked about Node.js URL parsing in CI - confirmed it's over-engineered, simpler alternatives exist.\n\n10. **Admin Package Fixes**: After backend PR merged, moved to admin package. Found 9 occurrences of `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` across 5 files. Changed all to `tenantId: 1`. TypeCheck passed (0 errors).\n\n11. **Go Backend schema.sql**: Changed `tenant.id` from `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` to `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, and all `tenant_id` from `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default-tenant'` to `INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenant`. Confirmed with `make migrate EXTRA_ARGS=\"--dry-run\"`.\n\n12. **User removed tenant-related columns from schema.sql**: The user/linter modified schema.sql to remove ALL tenant-related columns and the tenant table entirely from schema.sql (as seen in system reminders). This is because Go backend's schema.sql will be updated separately.\n\n13. **CI Migration Cleanup PR**: User wants to:\n   - Remove `db-migration.yaml`\n   - Remove migration comments from deploy workflows\n   - Create migration procedure doc at `docs/migration/README.md`\n\n14. **Plan Mode**: Created and approved plan for CI migration cleanup. About to start implementation.\n\nKey files modified throughout:\n- Backend: schema.prisma, migration.sql, seed.ts, 6 repository files, 14 mock files, 4 usecase/route files\n- Admin: 5 action.ts files\n- API: schema.sql (then user further modified it)\n- Workflows: db-migration.yaml (to be deleted), deploy-backend-dev.yaml, deploy-backend-production.yaml\n\nCurrent state: Plan approved, todo list created, about to start implementing CI migration cleanup.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user is implementing multi-tenancy Phase 1 for UTAGE3.0. This session covered multiple sub-tasks:\n   \n   **Completed:**\n   - Fixing remaining TypeScript type errors in backend repository files (`tenantId: string` → `tenantId: number`) - 6 files, 14 parameters\n   - Fixing admin package `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` → `tenantId: 1` across 5 files (9 occurrences)\n   - Updating Go backend `schema.sql` - `tenant.id` from `TEXT` to `SERIAL`, all `tenant_id` from `TEXT DEFAULT 'default-tenant'` to `INTEGER NOT NULL`\n   - Confirming dry-run migration for Go backend\n   - Discussing CI migration strategy with colleague feedback\n   \n   **In Progress:**\n   - Creating PR to remove CI migration workflows and create manual migration procedure docs\n   - Plan was approved, implementation about to begin\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Tenant ID type change**: `String @default(cuid())` → `Int @default(autoincrement())` (SERIAL in PostgreSQL)\n   - **firebase_tenant_id**: Kept as separate `TEXT UNIQUE` column (internal numeric ID + external service ID pattern)\n   - **Prisma ORM**: Schema changes cascade to generated types\n   - **psqldef**: Go backend's declarative schema migration tool\n   - **Cloud SQL Proxy**: Used for connecting to GCP Cloud SQL from local/CI\n   - **Dual backend**: Node.js (Prisma) + Go (psqldef) sharing same PostgreSQL database\n   - **CI migration removal**: Moving from automated CI migrations to manual procedure-based approach\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/user.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `upsertUserByEmail` method\n   \n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/payment.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `createPaymentMethod` and `createPaymentTransaction`\n   \n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/businesscard.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `upsertCheckinTransaction`, `createUserCertificate`, `createUserTradingCard`\n   \n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/event.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `upsertCheckinTransaction`, `createUserCertificate`, `createManyUserTradingCard`\n   \n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/pack.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `createTradingCardBenefitExchangeTransaction`, `createPaymentMethod`, `createCampaignPaymentTransaction`, `createManyUserTradingCards`\n   \n   - **`packages/backend/src/infra/repository/quiz.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in `createQuizSurvey`\n   \n   - **`packages/admin/app/certificate/action.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to `tenantId: 1`\n     - User/linter further removed the tenantId line entirely from create block\n   \n   - **`packages/admin/app/event/action.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to `tenantId: 1`\n     - User/linter further removed the tenantId line entirely\n   \n   - **`packages/admin/app/event/setlist/action.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to `tenantId: 1`\n     - User/linter further removed the tenantId line entirely\n   \n   - **`packages/admin/components/pages/operation/generate-checkin-code/action.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to `tenantId: 1`\n     - User/linter further removed the tenantId line and TODO comment entirely\n   \n   - **`packages/admin/components/pages/operation/top/action.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed all 5 occurrences of `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to `tenantId: 1` using replace_all\n     - User/linter further removed all tenantId lines and TODO comments entirely\n   \n   - **`packages/api/internal/db/schema.sql`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Changed `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` to `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` for tenant table\n     - Changed all `tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default-tenant' REFERENCES tenant` to `tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenant`\n     - User subsequently modified to remove ALL tenant-related columns and tenant table entirely (schema.sql now has no tenant references)\n   \n   - **`.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml`** (TO BE DELETED)\n     - Reusable workflow for Prisma migrations via Cloud SQL Proxy\n     - Currently not called by any workflow (all callers commented out)\n   \n   - **`.github/workflows/deploy-backend-dev.yaml`** (TO BE EDITED)\n     - Lines 49-61: Commented-out migration job calling db-migration.yaml, to be removed\n   \n   - **`.github/workflows/deploy-backend-production.yaml`** (TO BE EDITED)\n     - Lines 44-56: Commented-out migration job, to be removed\n     - Line 59: `# needs: migration` comment, to be removed\n   \n   - **`docs/migration/README.md`** (TO BE CREATED)\n     - Manual migration procedure document\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **TypeScript type errors in repository files (17 errors)**:\n     - Error: `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'` in routes/pairing/grantpack.ts, usecase/businesscard, event, pack, payment, quiz, user\n     - Root cause: Repository method parameters still had `tenantId: string` after Prisma schema changed to `Int`\n     - Fix: Changed `tenantId: string` to `tenantId: number` in all 6 repository files (14 parameters)\n     - After fix: `pnpm --filter backend typecheck` passed with 0 errors\n   \n   - **File not read error when editing admin files**:\n     - Error: `File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.`\n     - Fix: Read all 5 admin files first, then performed edits\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified that backend repository layer was the source of type errors (not the usecase or route files themselves)\n   - Verified `grantpack.ts` used `pairing.tenantId` from Prisma (already number), so fixing repository was sufficient\n   - Confirmed no remaining `tenantId: string` or `default-tenant` references via grep\n   - Confirmed dry-run migration showed no tenant-related diffs (DB already in sync)\n   - Resolved CI migration approach through team discussion\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"PR出します ブランチ名、コミットメッセージは何がいいかな？ idの型変更ということがわかればいい\"\n   - Long message about Go-side modifications with colleague comments about CI migration workflows, seed in CI, and suggesting manual migration approach\n   - \"そうしようかな あと、[Node.js URL parsing code] この実装にたいして「おしゃれ」てコメントあったんですが馬鹿にされてるように感じます笑 これってベストプラクティスなの？\"\n   - \"修正してpushしましたありがとう じゃあ次はapi（go）側の修正をしていきます [...] packages/api/internal/db/schema.sql だけの修正にします [...] を再度修正してください\"\n   - \"この修正でidがint型のautoincrementになりましたか？\"\n   - \"ありがとうございます。マイグレーション周りの運用についての会話の履歴覚えてますか？ciからマイグレーションしなくてもいいんじゃないか的な\"\n   - \"そうそうその会話です api（go）側もtenantIdをintにしてPR出しました。[...] この方針の修正は別PRで出したいので今からそれをやりたいと思っています。これは型修正のPRがマージされないとできませんか？そんなことないですよね？\"\n   - \"はいお願いします。その前に同僚のコメントから何をする必要がありますか？箇条書きで教えて\"\n   - \"全部同じPRでいいと思います 本番環境へのマイグレーションはどうしますか？こちらも.github/workflows/deploy-backend-production.yamlから行っていて、現在はマイグレーション部分がコメントアウトされてます また手順書はどこに作るのでしょうか？\"\n   - Answered questions: docs/migration/ for procedure docs, complete deletion for db-migration.yaml\n   - Approved the plan for CI migration cleanup\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Delete `.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml`\n   - Remove migration comments from `.github/workflows/deploy-backend-dev.yaml` (lines 49-61)\n   - Remove migration comments from `.github/workflows/deploy-backend-production.yaml` (lines 44-56, line 59)\n   - Create `docs/migration/README.md` with manual migration procedures\n   - Verify all changes\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The plan for \"CIマイグレーション廃止 & 手動マイグレーション手順書作成\" was just approved. A todo list was created with 5 items, with the first item \"Delete db-migration.yaml\" marked as `in_progress`. Implementation is about to begin.\n\n   The plan file is at `/Users/tachikawa_eiji/.claude/plans/hidden-wobbling-peach.md`.\n\n   Key Cloud SQL connection info from existing workflows:\n   - Dev: `utage3-dev:asia-northeast1:utage3`, service account: `github-service-account@utage3-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`\n   - Production: `utage3:asia-northeast1:utage3`, service account: `github-service-account@utage3.iam.gserviceaccount.com`\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Begin implementing the approved plan:\n   1. Delete `.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml`\n   2. Edit `deploy-backend-dev.yaml` to remove commented-out migration job (lines 49-61)\n   3. Edit `deploy-backend-production.yaml` to remove commented-out migration job (lines 44-56) and `# needs: migration` (line 59)\n   4. Create `docs/migration/README.md` with procedures for local, dev, and production migrations\n   \n   The user explicitly approved the plan and the todo list's first item is already `in_progress`.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1406,"cache_read_input_tokens":167460,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1406,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY71D4s7GwfyWDcR6d9Bg","type":"assistant","uuid":"bdb127ac-52c8-4537-b358-b197a7e3648d","timestamp":"2026-02-14T00:21:50.995Z"}
