Previous work included modifying Prisma schema with Tenant model + tenantId on all 19 tables, updating seed.ts, creating migration file, running migration successfully, and fixing mock files + usecase/event/index.ts for tenantId.\n\n2. **Current session start**: The assistant continued from where the previous session left off - fixing remaining typecheck errors in repository layer, route handlers, and test files.\n\n3. **The assistant's approach**:\n   - First explored the codebase to find all callers of repository create methods using a Task agent\n   - Read all affected files (repository, usecase, route handlers, test)\n   - Systematically fixed files in layers: repository → usecase callers → route handlers → test file\n   \n4. **Repository layer fixes** (4 files):\n   - `businesscard.ts` - 3 methods: upsertCheckinTransaction, createUserCertificate, createUserTradingCard\n   - `event.ts` - 3 methods: upsertCheckinTransaction, createUserCertificate, createManyUserTradingCard\n   - `pack.ts` - 4 methods: createTradingCardBenefitExchangeTransaction, createPaymentMethod, createCampaignPaymentTransaction, createManyUserTradingCards\n   - `payment.ts` - 2 methods: createPaymentMethod, createPaymentTransaction\n\n5. **Usecase layer fixes** (4 files):\n   - `businesscard/index.ts` - 3 calls using user.tenantId\n   - `event/index.ts` - 3 calls using user.tenantId\n   - `pack/index.ts` - 4 calls using user.tenantId\n   - `payment/index.ts` - 4 calls using user.tenantId\n\n6. **Route handler fixes** (5 files):\n   - `fincode/3ds/[...callback].ts` - using pack.tenantId\n   - `fincode/paypay/[...callback].ts` - using pack.tenantId\n   - `line/callback/index.ts` - using hardcoded \"default-tenant\" with TODO\n   - `pairing/grantpack.ts` - using pairing.tenantId and pack.tenantId\n   - `pairing/payment.ts` - using pack.tenantId\n\n7. **Test file fix**:\n   - `sortedCards.test.ts` - added tenantId: \"default-tenant\" to all 10 objects\n\n8. **First typecheck** revealed 2 more errors:\n   - `quiz.ts` - createQuizSurvey missing tenantId\n   - `user.ts` - upsertUserByEmail missing tenantId\n   \n9. **Additional fixes**:\n   - Fixed quiz.ts repository + quiz/index.ts usecase caller (using \"default-tenant\" with TODO)\n   - Fixed user.ts repository + user/index.ts usecase caller (using \"default-tenant\" with TODO)\n\n10. **Second typecheck** - passed cleanly\n\n11. **Test run** - 52 tests passed, 5 test suites failed due to pre-existing ZodError (missing env vars), unrelated to tenantId changes\n\nThe user did not send any messages in this session - this was a continuation from a previous session where the assistant was asked to fix CI test failures caused by missing tenantId fields.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user is implementing multitenancy (Phase 1: Database Schema Change) for the UTAGE3.0 platform. The overall task involves adding a `Tenant` model and `tenant_id` column to all 19 existing tables in Prisma schema. In the previous session, the user shared CI test failures and asked the assistant to fix them (\"はい今度はこれー\"). The current session is a continuation where the assistant was fixing remaining typecheck errors across repository layer, usecase callers, route handlers, and test files after the mock files and `usecase/event/index.ts` had already been fixed.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - PostgreSQL multi-tenant architecture with Row Level Security (RLS) planned for Phase 3\n   - Prisma ORM with `UncheckedCreateInput` (requires `tenantId` scalar) vs `CreateInput` (requires `tenant` relation)\n   - Firebase Identity Platform multi-tenancy (User:Tenant = N:1, each tenant has separate UID)\n   - JWT `firebase.tenant` claim for tenantId propagation (Phase 2)\n   - Clean architecture: Repository → Usecase → GraphQL/Route layers\n   - Dependency injection through context pattern (`ContextInject`)\n   - Repository `Option` pattern with `{ tx: Tx }` for transaction support\n   - 19 tables requiring tenant_id: User, Event, EventSetlist, Pack, PackPrice, PhysicalPack, Certificate, CheckinCode, CheckinTransaction, TradingCard, TradingCardBenefit, TradingCardBenefitExchangeTransaction, PackTradingCardRelation, UserCertificate, UserTradingCard, QuizSurvey, PaymentMethod, PaymentTransaction, Pairing\n   - Branch: `feat/add-tenant-table`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   **Repository Layer (adding `tenantId: string` to args and create data):**\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/businesscard.ts`\n     - 3 create methods needed tenantId: `upsertCheckinTransaction`, `createUserCertificate`, `createUserTradingCard`\n     - Pattern: added `tenantId: string` to args type, destructured it, added to Prisma create data\n     ```typescript\n     public async upsertCheckinTransaction(\n       args: {\n         checkinCodeId: string; eventId: number; uid: string; now: Date;\n         tenantId: string; // ADDED\n       }, ...\n     ) {\n       const { checkinCodeId, eventId, uid, now, tenantId } = args;\n       return tx.checkinTransaction.upsert({\n         ...\n         create: { userId: uid, eventId, checkinCodeId, receivedAt: now, createdAt: now, updatedAt: now, tenantId }, // ADDED\n       });\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/event.ts`\n     - 3 create methods: `upsertCheckinTransaction`, `createUserCertificate`, `createManyUserTradingCard`\n     - Same pattern as businesscard.ts. For createMany, tenantId added to each mapped item.\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/pack.ts`\n     - 4 create methods: `createTradingCardBenefitExchangeTransaction`, `createPaymentMethod`, `createCampaignPaymentTransaction`, `createManyUserTradingCards`\n     - Same pattern.\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/payment.ts`\n     - 2 create methods: `createPaymentMethod`, `createPaymentTransaction`\n     - Same pattern.\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/quiz.ts`\n     - 1 create method: `createQuizSurvey` - added `tenantId: string` to args\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/user.ts`\n     - 1 upsert method: `upsertUserByEmail` - added `tenantId: string` to args, added to create data\n\n   **Usecase Layer (passing tenantId from available entities):**\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/businesscard/index.ts`\n     - 3 calls updated to pass `tenantId: user.tenantId` (user fetched at line 59)\n     ```typescript\n     await repo.upsertCheckinTransaction({ ..., tenantId: user.tenantId }, { tx });\n     await repo.createUserCertificate({ ..., tenantId: user.tenantId }, { tx });\n     await repo.createUserTradingCard({ ..., tenantId: user.tenantId }, { tx });\n     ```\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/event/index.ts`\n     - 3 calls updated to pass `tenantId: user.tenantId` (user fetched at line 147)\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/pack/index.ts`\n     - 4 calls updated to pass `tenantId: user.tenantId`:\n       - `createTradingCardBenefitExchangeTransaction` (user at line 409)\n       - `createPaymentMethod` (user at line 468)\n       - `createCampaignPaymentTransaction`\n       - `createManyUserTradingCards`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/payment/index.ts`\n     - 4 calls updated (2 in `purchaseByCard`, 2 in `purchaseByPayPay`):\n       - `createPaymentMethod` with `tenantId: user.tenantId`\n       - `createPaymentTransaction` with `tenantId: user.tenantId`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/quiz/index.ts`\n     - Used `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` with `// TODO: Phase 2でコンテキストからtenantIdを取得する`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/user/index.ts`\n     - Used `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` with `// TODO: Phase 2でFirebase Tenant IDから動的に取得する`\n\n   **Route Handlers (direct Prisma calls):**\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/routes/gateway/fincode/3ds/[...callback].ts`\n     - `tx.userTradingCard.createMany` - added `tenantId: pack.tenantId`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/routes/gateway/fincode/paypay/[...callback].ts`\n     - `tx.userTradingCard.createMany` - added `tenantId: pack.tenantId`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/routes/gateway/line/callback/index.ts`\n     - `tx.user.upsert` create data - added `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` with TODO comment\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/routes/pairing/grantpack.ts`\n     - `repository.pack.createPaymentMethod` - added `tenantId: pairing.tenantId`\n     - `repository.pack.createCampaignPaymentTransaction` - added `tenantId: pairing.tenantId`\n     - `tx.userTradingCard.createMany` - added `tenantId: pack.tenantId`\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/routes/pairing/payment.ts`\n     - `tx.userTradingCard.createMany` - added `tenantId: pack.tenantId`\n\n   **Test File:**\n\n   - `packages/backend/src/usecase/pack/sortedCards.test.ts`\n     - Added `tenantId: \"default-tenant\"` to all 5 inline `TradingCardMapper` objects and all 5 `expect` assertions\n\n   **Schema/Type Files (read for reference):**\n   - `packages/backend/src/graphql/pack/schema.mappers.ts` - `TradingCardMapper extends TradingCard` (TradingCard now has tenantId)\n   - `packages/backend/src/infra/repository/utils.ts` - Option pattern `{ tx: Tx }`\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Initial typecheck errors (from previous session summary)**: ~20+ errors across repository, route handlers, and test files where Prisma create/createMany operations were missing the now-required `tenantId` field.\n     - Fixed by systematically adding `tenantId` to all repository method args, usecase callers, route handlers, and test data.\n   \n   - **Second round of typecheck errors** after fixing the initially known files:\n     - `src/infra/repository/quiz.ts` (line 43): `QuizSurveyUncheckedCreateInput` missing `tenantId`\n     - `src/infra/repository/user.ts` (line 70): `UserCreateInput` missing `tenant` relation\n     - Fixed by adding `tenantId` to both repository methods and their callers, using `\"default-tenant\"` with TODO comments where user context wasn't available.\n\n   - **Test failures (ZodError)**: 5 test suites failed due to missing environment variables (`APP_ENV`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.) - this is a pre-existing issue unrelated to tenantId changes. All 52 actual test cases passed.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Strategy for tenantId source**: For each create operation, determined the most appropriate source:\n     - Usecase methods with fetched `user` object → `user.tenantId`\n     - Route handlers with fetched `pack` → `pack.tenantId`\n     - Route handlers with fetched `pairing` → `pairing.tenantId`\n     - New user creation / quiz without user context → hardcoded `\"default-tenant\"` with TODO for Phase 2\n   - **Cascade management**: Repository method signature changes cascaded to usecase callers, which required tracing all call sites through the codebase using the Explore agent.\n   - Typecheck passes cleanly. All 52 tests pass.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - Previous session messages (from summary):\n     - \"一旦この状態でPR出しますか？ それともdeploy-backend-dev.yamlやdeploy-backlend-production.yamlも修正しますか？ 別の方がいっか\"\n     - \"そうですね、今のファイルをコミットします ブランチ切りますが、ブランチ名はなにがいいかな？ package.jsonにcodegenコマンドがありますが、これは実行しなくてもいいですか？\"\n     - \"いえ、feat/add-tenant-tableとします 僕の方で実行するので結構です\"\n     - \"ciで失敗したけどなんのエラー？\" (CI format error)\n     - \"はい今度はこれー\" (CI test error - the trigger for all the tenantId fixes)\n   - No new user messages in this current session (it was a continuation from the previous context)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Run `pnpm --filter backend format` before committing (Prisma format alignment issue from earlier CI failure)\n   - Commit and push changes to `feat/add-tenant-table` branch (user previously said they would handle git operations themselves)\n   - The user may need to verify CI passes after pushing\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The assistant completed all tenantId propagation fixes across the entire backend codebase. The work involved:\n   - Fixing 6 repository files (businesscard.ts, event.ts, pack.ts, payment.ts, quiz.ts, user.ts)\n   - Fixing 4 usecase files (businesscard/index.ts, event/index.ts, pack/index.ts, payment/index.ts, quiz/index.ts, user/index.ts)\n   - Fixing 5 route handler files (fincode/3ds, fincode/paypay, line/callback, pairing/grantpack, pairing/payment)\n   - Fixing 1 test file (sortedCards.test.ts)\n   - Plus the previously fixed 13 mock files and usecase/event/index.ts\n   \n   Final verification:\n   - `pnpm --filter backend typecheck` → **PASSED** (no errors)\n   - `pnpm --filter backend test` → **52 tests passed**, 5 suites failed with pre-existing ZodError (env vars)\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The tenantId fix work is complete. The user previously indicated they would handle git operations themselves (\"僕の方で実行するので結構です\"). The user should:\n   1. Run `pnpm --filter backend format` to fix Prisma format alignment\n   2. Commit and push to `feat/add-tenant-table`\n   3. Verify CI passes\n   \n   No further assistant action is needed unless the user reports new CI failures.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2691,"cache_read_input_tokens":167150,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2691},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY5NyoVaPv6zXBa2CT85m","type":"assistant","uuid":"543da9e4-a05b-4848-a681-f54037ca9f17","timestamp":"2026-02-13T03:46:02.007Z"}
