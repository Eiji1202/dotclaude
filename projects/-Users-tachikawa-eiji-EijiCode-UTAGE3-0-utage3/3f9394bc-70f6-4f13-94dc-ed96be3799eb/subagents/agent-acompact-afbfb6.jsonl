The previous session added Tenant model and tenantId to all 19 tables in Prisma schema, fixed backend code, admin code, and added TODO comments.\n\n2. **Current Session Focus**: The user's colleague pointed out that the migration workflow needs to use sqldef instead of Prisma, because the Go backend uses sqldef for schema management. The dev environment had errors (`column checkin_transaction.tenant_id does not exist`) because the migration wasn't run.\n\n3. **Key Work Done**:\n   - Read `packages/api/Makefile` to understand sqldef migration setup\n   - Discovered `packages/api/internal/db/schema.sql` didn't have tenant changes yet\n   - Updated `schema.sql` with tenant table and tenant_id on all 19 tables\n   - Rewrote `.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml` from Prisma to sqldef\n   - Uncommented migration job in `deploy-backend-dev.yaml`\n   - User ran `make migrate EXTRA_ARGS=\"--dry-run\"` locally - showed expected diffs\n   - User ran `make migrate` - applied successfully\n   - User ran dry-run again - confirmed zero diff (only `_prisma_migrations` skip)\n\n4. **User Questions and Explanations**:\n   - Various explanations about dry-run, local vs remote impact, Dockerfile changes, console.log in workflow, Seed Default Tenant purpose, id vs firebaseTenantId, Phase 1 → Phase 2 migration plan\n   - PR description was drafted\n   - Commit message suggested: `feat: migrate db-migration workflow from Prisma to sqldef`\n   - Code review comments were received and analyzed\n\n5. **PR Review Comments**: The user received review comments. I analyzed each:\n   - #1 (Seed Default Tenant duplication): Valid concern but necessary workaround\n   - #2-4 (sqlc, queries, transactions): All Phase 2 scope\n   - #5 (composite indexes): Premature optimization\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user is implementing multi-tenancy (Phase 1: Database Schema Change) for UTAGE3.0. This session focused specifically on:\n   - Updating `packages/api/internal/db/schema.sql` (sqldef schema) to include tenant table and tenant_id columns (matching the Prisma schema changes from the previous session)\n   - Rewriting `.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml` from Prisma to sqldef (`make migrate`)\n   - Uncommenting the migration job in `deploy-backend-dev.yaml`\n   - Understanding how the migration workflow works and preparing a PR\n   - Responding to PR review comments\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **sqldef (psqldef)**: Declarative schema migration tool for PostgreSQL used by the Go backend, replacing Prisma migrations\n   - **`make migrate`**: Runs `go tool psqldef` to compare schema.sql against actual DB and apply diffs\n   - **`--dry-run`**: Shows what SQL statements would be executed without applying them\n   - **Cloud SQL Proxy**: Used in CI to connect to GCP Cloud SQL instances; changed from socket mode to TCP mode (`=tcp:5432`) for psqldef compatibility\n   - **Seed Default Tenant**: Pre-migration step needed because sqldef only handles DDL (not DML), and FK constraints require the referenced tenant row to exist\n   - **DATABASE_URL parsing**: Using `node -e` with `new URL()` to extract user/password/db from the connection string\n   - **FK constraint validation**: PostgreSQL validates FK constraints when adding columns with DEFAULT values referencing another table\n   - **Idempotent operations**: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for safe re-runs\n   - **Tenant model**: `id` (cuid, internal) vs `firebaseTenantId` (Firebase Identity Platform tenant ID)\n   - **Phase 1 → Phase 2 migration plan**: default-tenant → real tenant cuid via UPDATE\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`packages/api/internal/db/schema.sql`** (MODIFIED)\n     - The sqldef schema file that defines the desired database state\n     - Added `tenant` table at the top and `tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default-tenant' REFERENCES tenant ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT` to all 19 tables with indexes\n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE tenant (\n       id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n       firebase_tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n       name TEXT NOT NULL,\n       created_at TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n       updated_at TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n     );\n     \n     CREATE TABLE event (\n       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n       name TEXT NOT NULL,\n       start_date TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,\n       header_image_url TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',\n       tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default-tenant' REFERENCES tenant ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,\n       created_at TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n       updated_at TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n     );\n     CREATE INDEX event_tenant_id_idx ON event (tenant_id);\n     -- ... (same pattern for all 19 tables)\n     ```\n\n   - **`.github/workflows/db-migration.yaml`** (REWRITTEN)\n     - Changed from Prisma (`pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy`) to sqldef (`make migrate`)\n     - Key changes: Go setup, TCP Cloud SQL Proxy, DATABASE_URL parsing, Seed Default Tenant step\n     ```yaml\n     name: DB Migration\n     on:\n       workflow_call:\n         inputs:\n           environment:\n             type: string\n             required: true\n           cloud_sql_instance:\n             type: string\n             required: true\n           workload_identity_provider:\n             type: string\n             required: true\n           service_account:\n             type: string\n             required: true\n         secrets:\n           DATABASE_URL:\n             required: true\n           SLACK_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL:\n             required: true\n     concurrency:\n       group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ inputs.environment }}-db-migration\n       cancel-in-progress: true\n     env:\n       TZ: Asia/Tokyo\n     defaults:\n       run:\n         working-directory: ./packages/api\n     jobs:\n       migrate:\n         runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n         permissions:\n           contents: read\n           id-token: write\n         steps:\n           -

Errors and fixes:\n   - **No code errors in this session** - the workflow changes were reviewed conceptually\n   - **Important discovery**: `deploy-backend-dev.yaml` triggers only on `packages/backend/**` path changes, so merging won't auto-trigger the migration. Manual `workflow_dispatch` is needed.\n   - **PR Review Comments received** (from automated review):\n     - #1 Seed Default Tenant duplication: Valid concern but necessary due to sqldef limitations. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is needed because the seed runs BEFORE sqldef and tenant table may not exist yet.\n     - #2 sqlc code generation not run: Acknowledged as Phase 2 scope\n     - #3 SQL queries don't consider tenant_id: Phase 2 scope\n     - #4 Transaction handling: Phase 2 scope\n     - #5 Composite indexes: Premature, Phase 2\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified that schema.sql was missing tenant changes (root cause of dev environment errors)\n   - Designed the Seed Default Tenant workaround for sqldef's DDL-only limitation\n   - Verified schema.sql correctness via local dry-run and actual migration\n   - Confirmed zero diff after migration (schema.sql and DB in sync)\n   - Identified that deploy-backend-dev.yaml won't auto-trigger (paths filter issue)\n\n6.

Pending Tasks:\n   - Respond to PR review comments (the user was about to add comments to the PR explaining the Phase 1 scope and Seed Default Tenant rationale)\n   - After PR is merged, manually trigger `deploy-backend-dev.yaml` via workflow_dispatch to run the migration on dev environment\n   - Branch name: `feat/add-tenant-table-api`\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The user submitted a PR and received automated review comments. The assistant analyzed each review comment:\n   - #1 (Seed Default Tenant duplication): Valid but necessary workaround\n   - #2-5: All Phase 2 scope, not applicable to this PR\n   \n   The user was about to respond to the PR review comments, specifically wanting to explain the \"default-tenant\" value in code comments and the Seed Default Tenant rationale in the PR.\n\n   The Phase 1 → Phase 2 migration plan was explained:\n   1. Firebase Consoleでテナント作成 → firebaseTenantId を取得\n   2. DBのtenantテーブルにcuid + firebaseTenantIdで登録\n   3. 既存データの tenant_id を 'default-tenant' → cuidに UPDATE\n   4. コードの tenantId: \"default-tenant\" をJWTから取得するロジックに変更\n   5. 'default-tenant' 行を削除\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The user's most recent message was sharing PR review comments and asking \"これらについてはどう思いますか？\" (What do you think about these?). The assistant provided analysis.
